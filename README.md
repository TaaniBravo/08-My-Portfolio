# Updated Portfolio

This is an updated portfolio with some of my actual work this time and a downloadable resume. I wanted to recreate the page with the newfound knowledge for APIs and JavaScript. From now on this HTML is where I will continue to update my journey as a full-stack developer.

## My Journey
This assignment felt like second nature to me as I already had an idea of what I wanted the page to look like. So going into the project, I really just started hammering away at this. I only came across issues when implementing the CSS transitions while also making the sections disappear based on buttons pressed. It took me a few attempts at the code but ultimately it came out great and the code is very simple to where it could be applied elsewhere.
